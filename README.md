# Socket Chat

## What is it?

A simple chat client built using Node.js, Express and Socket.io

It's a single chat room, set up to use browser notifications. Everything is run on a server instance, no data is persisted if the server is shut down. If the server remains live, the last 10 messages will be displayed to whoever joins.

## How to use

1.  Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed in your environment.

2.  Copy files into the directory you wish to use.

3.  Navigate to the directory in command line.

4.  Run `node index.js`

5.  Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
